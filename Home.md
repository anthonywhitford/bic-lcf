**Planning on asking questions or contributing?** 

Please make sure that your GitHub profile says something about your interest in LCF, perhaps which company you're working for or similar. This helps us correctly categorise our responses to questions and our feedback.

**Is there anything you'd like to do using LCF?**
If there are any business processes that you're looking to implement using LCF, but perhaps are unsure how to do so, please raise an issue. This allows us to review your needs and assist you with getting going.
