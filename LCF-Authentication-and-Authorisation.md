# Authentication and Authorisation

At the #Plugfest2 event and detailed in Issues [#24](https://github.com/anthonywhitford/bic-lcf/issues/24) and [#55](https://github.com/anthonywhitford/bic-lcf/issues/55) there have been discussions about the authentication mechanisms available in LCF relating to both Patrons and Service Terminals. This page defines what th outcome of those two conversations is. Within the LCF Review Panel meeting on 22nd February 2018, all attendees agreed that Patron Authentication was a critical issue that required immediate resolution. We agreed that the content of issues [#24](https://github.com/anthonywhitford/bic-lcf/issues/24) and [#55](https://github.com/anthonywhitford/bic-lcf/issues/55) would be written up and approved for LCF inclusion automatically on Friday 2nd March 2018.

If there are any challenges to the adoption of this change, please highlight this immediately by raising a high priority issue within the issue tracker and assigning it directly to Anthony Whitford, or any of the other Technical Editors of this standard.
