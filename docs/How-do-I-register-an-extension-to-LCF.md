LCF is changing it's approach to extensibility. 

While we create a wiki page about extensions, the Review Panel meeting on 22nd February 2018 agreed that:
* Any extension to any LCF Entity must define it's fields in a separate schema, and separate namespace.
* Any additional service end-point (URL/URI), must be outside of the "/lcf/" path. We recommend "/lcf-extensions/"
* Any extensions must be registered within the Issue tracker, including the schema definition, the URI used and the use case for extension.
